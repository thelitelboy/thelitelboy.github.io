My first "Big" application programmed in C. An updated clone of the 1980 videogame, Star Castle. ([Wikipedia][SC-Wikipedia], [Youtube][SC-Youtube]). Although it has some error that another, I can not be but proud of my first video game :D

I have to say that the game is in Spanish because we had to do the project in that language, sorry for the inconvenience.
