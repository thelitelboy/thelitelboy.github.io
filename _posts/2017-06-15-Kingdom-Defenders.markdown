### Details
* C#
* Unity3D
* Windows - WebGL
* Procedural Biome Generation
* 3 Programmers

This is a small project we did for a subject, the idea was to release it on google play but we finally were not able to do so. Anyway, I am really happy with the result, it is a game produced in Unity3D. We had previously worked with Unity, but this was the first project of considerable size we made.

Here I investigated the concept of procedural generation generating different biomes on the map. On each biome you can construct something special, for example, you can build mineshafts in rocky biomes or sawmills on forests. We also provided 3 special maps for this game, plains, desert and ice. I also worked with hexagonal grid maps which were a hard job for my first time, especially the control with the mouse to select boxes. But it was as instructive as it was interesting and fun. 

The gameplay is quite simple, you build towers to defend the king tower (with a huge crown) and mineshafts and sawmills to get resources. Meanwhile, you will be attacked by jumping slimes.
