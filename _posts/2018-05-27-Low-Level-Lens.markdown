### Details
* C - ASM
* Linux - Ubuntu
* Fixed Point Integer
* Raspberri Pi
* Optimization

This was a project done by a partner and me, in which we had to implement the effect of lens on an image. This project was realised in C and using Ubuntu (Linux). The project was to implement the effect and then optimize it measuring the processor cycles. We used Fixed floating points, shifter operands... and we tried to minimize the loops and the memory acceses. 

Tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 model b.
