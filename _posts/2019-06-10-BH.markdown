### Details

I started to work on Bulkhead Interactive on June 2019 as a Gameplay Programmer for their game [Battalion 1944][Battalion-link] for a few months, then I worked on the console version of the same game and right now IÂ´m working in [PROMOD][Promod-link]. 

Learning about gameplay programming and working with the design team to create a great prototype for PROMOD.
