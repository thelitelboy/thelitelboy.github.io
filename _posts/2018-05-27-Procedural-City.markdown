This is my first approach to OpenGL, the exercise was to generate a "procedural City" so we rendered many boxes with building textures and other boxes (scalen in Y) so they look like floor. In my case I genrated some City Centers, and after some iterations where there was very probable to appear a building if there is another one near the city looked like a real one, more or less. I also implemented algorithms to place roads, trees and fountains around the buildings, althought everything was made of cubes. We also worked with many interesting things, such as skyboxes, post processes, frame buffers..
