This is my first approach to OpenGL, the exercise was to generate a "procedural City" so we rendered many boxes with building textures and other boxes (scalen in Y) so they look like floor. In my case I genrated some City Centers, and after some iterations where there was very probable to appear a building if there is another one near the city looked like a real one, more or less.
