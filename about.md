## Who am I?
My name is Imanol Saenz, I am a programmer interested in the computing world. HND in Computing and Systems Development at ESAT, Valencia, Spain. Currently working to get a BSc (Honours) at Sheffield Hallam University at Computer Science for Games.

I am looking forward to work in the video games industry, to continue learning from people with experience and passion for video games.

I have programmed many games in many groups and I have also programmed a game engine, currently I am programming my second one. I also have a published game on steam as a free to play which won a best narrative award at Student Game Contest 2018.

I like participating in Game Jams, I think itâ€™s a great way to learn new things as you are experimenting. My favourite type of games are those with a huge world where you can spend hours and hours doing whatever you want, following an story or not, for example Monster Hunter, The Elder Scrolls... But I am also a big fan of games with an interesting story to tell as Portal or Bioshock. 

## My Job
I have not been so much time in this industry to have many works but I am proud of my little achievements. Currently Working at Bulkhead Interactive.

I really like optimization, maths and physics. I have practised in Graphics Programming, first with the Procedural City, my first attempts with OpenGL, and later with My First 3D Engine. I have also researched and experimented with physics programming in my own engine. 

Two of my games are published, [Gamble Of Gods][GOG-Link] on Steam and [Street Rumble][SR-Link] on Itchio, both of them can be dowloaded and played.


## Currently Working At

Currently, I am working at Bulkhead Interactive as a Junior Gameplay Programmer, working for battalion 1944.
