## Who am I?
My name is Imanol Saenz, I am a programmer interested in the computing world. HND in Computing and Systems Development at ESAT, Valencia, Spain. Currently working to get a BSc (Honours) at Sheffield Hallam University at Computer Science for Games.

I am looking forward to work in the video games industry, to continue learning from people with experience and passion for video games. I want to learn more about gameplay programming and gameplay design to be able to create my own games in the future.

I have programmed many games in many groups and I have also programmed a game engine. I also have a published game on steam as a free to play which won a best narrative award at Student Game Contest 2018. 

## My Job
I have developed multiple personal proyects wich I'm quite fond of. And also multiple professional projects both in Bulkhead Int. and Creative Assembly.

I really like optimization, maths and physics. I have practised in Graphics Programming, first with the Procedural City, my first attempts with OpenGL, and later with My First 3D Engine. I have also researched and experimented with physics programming in my own engine. 

Two of my games are published, [Gamble Of Gods][GOG-Link] on Steam and [Street Rumble][SR-Link] on Itchio, both of them can be dowloaded and played.
