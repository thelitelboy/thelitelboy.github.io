## Who am I?
Hi! My name is Imanol Saenz, I am a programmer interested in the logic world. HND in Computing and Systems Development at ESAT, Valencia, Spain. Currently working to get a BSc(Honors) at Sheffield Hallam University at Computer Science for Games. 

I am looking forward to work in the video games industry, to continue learning from people in the industry and working with people who like this industry as much as I do. 

## My Job
I have not been so much time in this industry to have many works but I am proud of my little achievements. My current work will be available on my **blog** soon.

I am not particularly good at the graphics section, but I really like optimization, maths and physics. Anyway, I have practised in Graphics Programming, first with the **Procedural City**, my first attempts with OpenGL, and later with **My First 3D Engine**. Researching game-physics different implementations.


## Currently Working At

Currently I am working in two main projects and other small investigations in my own. 

* **New Physics Engine**, a WIP phisics engine.
* A new game I am developing with two friends, aiming for PS4, but we can not talk about it for now.

Really excited about both projects, I have already done some games in Unreal Engine but this one is the first one where I have absolute freedom to develop my own ideas. Also it is the first time I attemp to do videogame physics so I can't wait to see how it ends :D
