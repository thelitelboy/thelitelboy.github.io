## Who am I?
My name is Imanol Saenz, I am a programmer interested in the computing world. HND in Computing and Systems Development at ESAT, Valencia, Spain. Currently working to get a BSc (Honours) at Sheffield Hallam University at Computer Science for Games.

I am looking forward to work in the video games industry, to continue learning from people with experience and passion for video games.

I have programmed many games in many groups and I have also programmed a game engine, currently I am programming my second one. I also have a published game on steam as a free to play which won a best narrative award at Student Game Contest 2018.

I like participating in Game Jams, I think itâ€™s a great way to learn new things as you are experimenting. My favourite type of games are those with a huge world where you can spend hours and hours doing whatever you want, following an story or not, for example Minecraft, Monster Hunter, The Elder Scrolls... But I am also a big fan of games with an interesting story to tell as Portal, Bioshock or Dishonored. 

## My Job
I have not been so much time in this industry to have many works but I am proud of my little achievements. My current work will be available on my blog soon.

I really like optimization, maths and physics. I have practised in Graphics Programming, first with the Procedural City, my first attempts with OpenGL, and later with My First 3D Engine. Researching game-physics different implementations.


## Currently Working At

Currently I am working in two main projects and other small investigations in my own. 

* **New Physics Engine**, a WIP new physics engine.
* A new game I am devoloping on a team for ps4, yet we cant talk about it.

Really excited about both projects, I have already done some games in Unreal Engine but this one is the first one where I have absolute freedom to develop my own ideas. Also it is the first time I attemp to do videogame physics so I can't wait to see how it ends :D
