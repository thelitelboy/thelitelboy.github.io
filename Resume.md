I’m a young programmer desiring to learn more about the gampelay programming world and to improve my skills. Experienced using C++, Unity and Unreal.

I am looking forward to work in the video games industry, to continue learning from people with experience and passion for video games, so I can learn and create my own games in the future.

I like participating in Game Jams, I think it’s a great way to learn new things as you are experimenting. My favourite type of games is those with a huge world where you can spend hours and hours doing whatever you want, following a story or not, for example, Monster Hunter, The Elder Scrolls… But I am also a big fan of games with an interesting story to tell as Portal or Bioshock .
